General (above studies table)
=============================

Network Meta-Analysis (or Mixed Treatment Comparison, MTC) is a technique to meta-analyze more than two drugs at the same time. Using a full Bayesian evidence network, all indirect comparisons are taken into account to arrive at a single, integrated, estimate of the effect of all included treatments based on all included studies.

This software is meant as a demonstration of the sort of analysis enabled by MTCs. The functionality provided is not yet sufficient to do a full MTC analysis, as concerns such as the assessment of convergence of the Bayesian model and the adequacy of the run-length cannot be addressed. If you are interested in doing such an analysis, you can find more information at http://drugis.org/mtc, or contact Gert van Valkenhoef, the corresponding author.

===================

Please note that the current implementation of the Bayesian model using the Yadas MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) is not completely accurate due to the lack of a multi-variate normal density in Yadas. We have contacted the author of Yadas to remedy this, so far with no result.

Because of this, the covariance structure of multi-arm studies is not correctly represented. If multi-arm studies dominate the evidence network, this means that the results of the analysis may be unreliable. If multi-arm studies are not included, this problem does not occur.

An alternative implementation using JAGS and R that does not have this problem is available from http://drugis.org/mtc, but is more difficult to use.
